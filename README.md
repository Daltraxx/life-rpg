# LifeRPG

This is an application where users can create accounts in which they define the personal attributes they wish to hone or improve as well as the regular tasks ("quests") that will earn experience points towards both leveling those attributes and their overall player level. The levelling system is designed to reward players who complete their quests consistently to encourage habit formation and strengthening. In short, the goal of this application is to help users bolster the reward they feel from accomplishing daily productivity goals by emulating the feedback loop of RPGs. In other words, the overarching goal is help those who feel they could benefit from such a system reap real-life progress towards manifesting their aspirational goals. 


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
