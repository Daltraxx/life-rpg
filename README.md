# LifeRPG

LifeRPG is an application where users create accounts to define personal attributes they wish to hone and regular tasks ("quests") that earn experience points. These quests level both individual attributes and overall player level.

The leveling system rewards consistent quest completion to encourage habit formation. By emulating the feedback loop of RPGs, LifeRPG helps users feel more rewarded when accomplishing daily productivity goals.

The overarching goal is to help users who feel they'd benefit from such a system reap real-life progress towards their aspirational goals.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
